## Project Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the implementation and application of fundamental machine learning algorithms. Each notebook is self-contained and includes explanations, code, and visualizations.

## Notebooks

- **K_MeansClustering.ipynb**  
  Implementation and visualization of the K-Means clustering algorithm.

- **Linear_Regression.ipynb**  
  Step-by-step guide to linear regression, including data visualization and model evaluation.

## Datasets Used

- **K MeansClustering Dataset/**  
  Directory containing data for K-Means clustering. (See: [Customer Segmentation Tutorial in Python (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python))

- **Linear Regresion Dataset/**  
  Directory containing data for linear regression. (See: [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data))

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Ultimatrix.git
cd Ultimatrix-main
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- numpy
- pandas
